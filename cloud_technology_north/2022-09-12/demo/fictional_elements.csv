Name,Source,Uses
Adamant / Adamantine,Greek mythology,"Adamant has long meant any impenetrably or unyieldingly hard substance and, formerly, a legendary stone or mineral of impenetrable hardness and many other properties, often identified with diamond or lodestone. The English word is both a noun and an adjective; from Latin adamans 'impregnable, diamondlike hardness; very firm/resolute position', from Greek adamastos 'untameable' (hence also the word diamond). Adamant or adamantine (suffix -ine 'of the nature of' or 'made of') occur in many works. In myth, Kronos uses an adamantine sickle to castrate his father Uranus; in Prometheus Bound, Prometheus is bound to rocks ""in adamantine bonds infrangible""; in Virgil's Aeneid, columns of solid adamantine protect the gates of Tartarus; in Paradise Lost, adamant and adamantine are mentioned eight times to describe the gates of hell, Satan's shield, fallen angel's armor and Satan's chains. In fiction Adamant is referred to in the film Forbidden Planet (as ""adamantine steel""); many books such as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Faerie Queene, Gulliver's Travels, His Dark Materials, The Lord of the Rings, Mathilda (by Mary Shelley), and A Midsummer Night's Dream; and many games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy and RuneScape. The word adamant is the basis for fictional materials such as Adamantium and Adamantite (see below), Adamantle in The Sims, and Adiamante in L. E. Modesitt Jr.'s 1996 novel of the same name."
Adamantite,Various,"A metal ore in many fictional universes. In Final Fantasy it is used to make armor; its source is in another world; it can contain great amounts of energy. In World of Warcraft, it is a rare ore used to make weapons and armor of uncommon, rare and epic grade. In The Dark Elf Trilogy by R. A. Salvatore set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe it is used to make drow weaponry. It is also used for armor in The Elder Scrolls III, and in the game Terraria it is a red ore used to produce armor and other items. The name is from the word adamant (see above), with suffix -ite for names of minerals."
Adamantium,Marvel Comics,"Fictional alloy. First appears in Marvel's Avengers #66 (July 1969), by writer Roy Thomas and artists Barry Windsor-Smith and Syd Shores. First presented as part of the character Ultron's outer shell, but best known as the substance bonded to the character Wolverine's skeleton and claws. Adamantium's defining quality is its near-indestructibility. Adamantium is not depicted as a naturally occurring metal but as having been inadvertently invented by fictional American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain in trying to recreate his prior discovery, a unique alloy of steel and vibranium. Despite its potential uses in armament and armature, adamantium is rarely used due to high cost and inability to be reshaped. Other forms of adamantium of varying durability are mentioned in the Marvel Universe, including Secondary Adamantium, Adamantium Beta and Carbonadium. Besides Ultron's outer shell and Wolverine's skeleton and claws, Adamantium is associated with a number of other characters and implements including but not limited to, Bullseye's spinal column, certain iterations of Captain America's shield and Lady Deathstrike's skeleton and talons. Adamantium is also used in the Games Workshop universe of Warhammer 40000 and the MMORPG Maplestory."
Administratium,Scientific in-joke,"First referenced in a 1989 issue of The Physics Teacher. It was apparently discovered by the fictional Thomas Kyle, who was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for physics for his discovery, and it is a parody on bureaucracy of scientific establishments and on descriptions of newly discovered chemical elements."
Administrontium,Scientific in-joke,Similar to Administratium and a variation of the joke. It was referenced in a 1993 print.
Aether,Final Fantasy XIV,"In the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, Aether is one of the main elements of life and magic in the world."
Aether,Magic: The Gathering,"Aether (previously spelled Æther) is the main type of energy filling the blind eternities in the Magic: The Gathering multiverse, though it can also appear in variable quantities within the planes. Inextricably associated with magic in Magic's shared fictional universe and the use of the word in several Magic cards implies that casting magic involves channeling and manipulating Aether. ""Summoning"" the creatures around which combat and much of gameplay in Magic revolves is described as ""pulling (them) from the Aether""."
Afraidium,Robots (2005 film),An element made up by Fender. Fender says it is yellow and tastes like chicken.
Antidermis,Bionicle,"Greenish-black gas; forms the essence of the Makuta, the main villains of the series. They usually keep the antidermis inside suits of armor."
"Aquelium, terrelium, and plutulium",The Goddess of Atvatabar,"Three precious metals found in Earth's interior. Aquelium is a bright green metal derived from the interior ocean, and terrelium is a vermilion metal found only in Atvatabar. When these two metals come in contact, they produce a harnessable form of energy called magnicity."
Arenak,Skylark series,"A synthetic metal made by Osnomians. Vastly superior to the best steel. Usually transparent, but substances may be added to make it colored or opaque. Requires salt, which is very rare on Osnome, as a catalyst in its manufacture."
Arsonium,I Expect You to Die,"Green liquid with symbol Ar and atomic number 7. Makes a compound that is corrosive to copper when mixed with Galine and Sanite, and a compound that produces clouds when exposed to air when mixed with Regalite. The real element 7 is nitrogen; and symbol Ar = argon."
Atium,Mistborn,"Metal. Forms the body and power of the shard Ruin. If an Allomancer burns Atium, it lets them see a few seconds into the future as a ghostly image overlaid on the present. This is a significant advantage in combat; it lets them know every move the opponent will make. This is canceled if the opponent burns Atium or electrum: it causes a feedback loop, so the user sees a mess of possible futures. It is extremely valuable in the Final Empire, as it is both very rare and hoarded by the Lord Ruler. The only place it is found is the pits of Hathsin, where small nuggets form in geodes mined by slaves. Using allomancy near the crystals that form the geodes, destroys them. When used by a Feruchemist, it allows them to store age and, if compounded, can cause a complete stop of ageing. Its name comes from the holder of the shard, Ati. In the Wax and Wayne era, no samples exist and it is called 'the lost metal'. It forms the alloy Malatium, or eleventh metal, a metal that allows the user to see past versions of other people. A misting that burns Atium is known as a seer. Hemalurgic effects are unknown."
Australium,Team Fortress 2,"Extremely valuable element in Team Fortress 2 by Valve. In-game, it is a special type of weapon, and as the fuel for the rocket in the map SD_Doomsday in the Special Delivery game mode. In the bonus comics on the Team Fortress website, their role is fleshed out more; The Life-Extending machines used by The Administrator, Blutarch, Redmond, and Gray Mann are powered by Australium, and a large part of the plot revolves around hiding the vast stores of Australium. Australium, found in Australia, hence the name, makes one smarter over time, but at the cost of increasing 'manliness and beard levels' in those who use it. It looks similar to the real element gold."
Bavarium,Just Cause 3,"Discovered by Medici's tyrannical ruler Sebastiano Di Ravello in the late 1980s. Is called a ""supermineral"" due to its near-infinite potential. Exclusive to Medici, Bavarium is at the core of much of the country's experimental weaponry and equipment, which, as of the Bavarium Sea Heist DLC, includes gravity manipulators and personal force fields; as well as a major export; Di Ravello is able to use it as a bargaining chip when dealing with the Agency. In-game, Bavarium (at least in refined form) is shown to be highly volatile and prone to big explosions; a small Bavarium-based charge can instantly destroy all but the largest of the game's Chaos Objects."
Bolognium / Bolonium,Various,"Metallic element with variable properties; or in sci-fi, a substance or process invented to circumvent explanation or impossibility. Or any unspecified substance: ""if not oil then beryllium, and if not beryllium then bolognium"", ""don't worry about whether it is mercury or lead or cadmium or 'bolognium'."" A humorous story (1926) about development of alloys for special purposes, describes Bolognium as a metallic element with properties similar to Gafnium, with which it forms alloys impervious to attack by mice.   Sci-fi writer David Gerrold attributes the use of the term in sci-fi writing to Larry Niven, author of Ringworld, who used it to describe imaginary material or processes that can give properties unachievable by known or scientifically-postulated means. In Worlds of Wonder, Gerrold describes two examples from Ringworld: scrith, strong enough to be used to build a ring 3×108 km in diameter; and a character deliberately bred for luck. Gerrold calls bolognium ""technobabble"", and cautions against overusing it, or using it carelessly; doing so harms the illusion of reality which good sci-fi needs. In the 1982 sci-fi comedy Big Meat Eater, Bolonium makes up a meat-based fuel; the comedy rock band Bolonium gets its name from said reference. In The Simpsons, ""Bolognium"", chemical symbol Bo, appears in the place of molybdenum, on promotional copies of the periodic table produced by Oscar Mayer (its atomic weight is ""delicious"" or ""snacktacular""), and in Futurama, where Cubert Farnsworth exclaims, ""your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolognium!""  Most references to Bolognium are intentionally humorous; but in Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars, Greg Cox refers to the ""bolognium shielding"" of Klingon warp nacelles."
Bombastium,Disney,"Originally appearing in Uncle Scrooge #17 (1957) by Carl Barks, Bombastium is stated to be the world's rarest element. Very coveted, but its  potential use is not fully known. It tastes different every time one tries it. Scientists find that one atom of it dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream; a different flavor of ice cream each time. To avoid evaporation, bombastium must be kept frozen. When this totally new element is discovered Scrooge tries to secure the entire supply – a ball of “Bombastium” about the size of a large turnip. Terrified that his acquisition will melt before he can make a profit, Scrooge drags Donald Duck and his nephews on a voyage to the South Pole to safeguard his investment, but he has not reckoned on the ruthless determination of the Brutopian agents he outbid to achieve it. Bombastium represents a play on words (bomb and bombastic) that negotiates Cold War hysteria about the arms race and the threat of Armageddon due to the H-bomb. Barks' tale is also grounded in fears. The substance is later used in the Duck Tales series."
Bonnevillium,Giants series,"One of three stable transuranic elements predicted by the new science of nucleonics in James P. Hogan's Giants series. Not naturally occurring outside of neutron stars, but trace amounts are created at the detonation of nucleonic weapons."
Bureaucratium,Scientific in-joke,"Similar to Administratium and variation of the joke. In this version of the joke, Bureaucratium is an element which has a negative half-life, becoming more massive and sluggish as time goes by."
Byzanium,Raise the Titanic!,"Fictional element in the book Raise the Titanic! and its film adaptation, which is a main focus of the story arc. It is a powerful radioactive material sought by both the Americans and Russians for use as either an energy source for a missile defense system or an atomic superbomb. The largest known natural source of Byzanium was on the island of Novaya Zemlya, which was mined in the early 20th century and supposedly taken aboard the ill-fated Titanic during her first and only voyage."
Carbonadium,Marvel Comics,"A form of adamantium, developed in the USSR and used by the anti-hero Deadpool, whose katanas are made with the material, and the villain Omega Red, whose retractable metal tentacles are made of it. Carbonadium is nearly as strong as adamantium, but more flexible. It is also used in the armor suit of Moon Knight in the third series of that comic.  It emits toxic radiation and can impede superhuman healing factors."
Cargonite,4D Man,"A super-dense, impenetrable substance developed by Tony Nelson. His brother Scott steals his work and starts fooling around with it, eventually gaining the ability to pass through solid matter."
Caterium,Satisfactory,Gold-like metal used to create highly advanced technology in mid and late game.
Cavorite,The First Men in the Moon,"In the H.G. Wells novel, a metal created by the physicist Cavor. Blocks gravity. Thus his spacecraft is selectively immune to gravity; one can choose which heavenly bodies it falls toward, by opening or sliding outer hull Cavorite ""windows or blinds"". This steers, accelerates and slows the spacecraft, dependent on available gravitational fields, somewhat analogous to a ""tacking"" behavior of a sailed ship."
Celestial Bronze,Rick Riordan,"(Introduced in The Lightning Thief.) Magic form of bronze mined from Mount Olympus, tempered in Mount Etna, and cooled in the River Lethe. Cannot touch non-magical creatures. Lethal to monsters."
Ceratanium,Mega Man,"Ceratanium (ceramic titanium) is shown to be quite useful. It is sturdy yet lightweight; and Magnet Man in the comic series, says it is paramagnetic. It is thus used in multiple robots, being the key component in Mega Man's armor, the Metal Blades of Metal Man, Cut Man's Rolling Cutter, and Hard Man's body."
Chelonium,Discworld,"According to the wizards at the Unseen University, the species Chelys galactica, including Great A'Tuin, are largely made of this element. Its properties are apparently known them (but not to the readers of the series's books)."
Chlorophyte,Terraria,"A bright-green metal found deep beneath the jungle, implied to be the toughest ore that can be mined from the ground (topped only by Luminite, a material dropped by the final boss). True to its name, Chlorophyte has plant-themed properties, and can be used to craft armor and weapons that harness the powers of plants. It can be combined with glowing mushrooms to make Shroomite, a blue fungi-themed version of the same metal used in ranged weapons and armor, or with ectoplasm to create Spectre Bars, a glowing ghost-themed metal used in various magical weapons and mage armor."
Chronoton (or chroniton),Various,"From Greek χρόνος (Chronos, 'time') +  -ον  (-on, 'elementary particle'). Associated with manipulating or traveling through time in Star Trek; and in Futurama, where it also has rejuvenating effects. A chronoton bomb in Teen Titans destroys chronotons in a given area, stopping that area's progression through time. The material has also been featured in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."
Cobalt Thorium G,"Dr. Strangelove, Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot","In Strangelove, an element used in the Russian doomsday device. Both (real) elements cobalt and thorium can be used in nukes to increase fallout, which agrees with the sense in which ""Cobalt Thorium G"" is used in the movie.
In the ""Wages of Fire"" episode Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot, it is revealed that the BGY-11 is powered by a Cobalt Thorium G power core."
Coaxium,Solo: A Star Wars Story,A material mined on the planet Kessel. Used as an extremely potent spacecraft fuel.
Computronium,Philosophy and futurism,"Condensed matter ""computing substrate"" that has the maximum computing power theoretically possible.  Some authors have speculated on the possibility of turning entire planets, or even the whole universe into computronium and what this would mean for humanity, or indeed, if humanity would even be needed after creating intelligences of such ""Godlike power""."
Collapsium,The Terro-Human Future History,"First mentioned by H. Beam Piper in his Terro-Human Future History series. Piper describes it as ""the electron shells of the atoms collapsed upon the nuclei, the atoms in actual contact.""  Collapsium can only be worked by abrasion with cosmic rays. Resistant to both ordinary matter projectiles and all forms of radiation, and can be plated on to ordinary steel to form a protective layer. The main use for collapsium is as armor for spacecraft."
Collapsium,The Collapsium,A material made of black holes; can be used to warp space and time in accordance with the wishes of its inventor.
Corrodium,Ben 10,"High-energy-yielding and unpredictable extraterrestrial mineral from Anur Khufos; used as a power source. Very dangerous: those exposed to it can mutate into hideous creatures (once exposure to Corrodium is removed, the mutants return to normal). The only ones immune to its mutative effects are those from the Anur system."
Dagal,Skylark,"A synthetic metal made by the Urvanians. Superior to the Arenak made by their enemies, the Osnomians."
Dalekanium,Doctor Who,"(Introduced in The Dalek Invasion of Earth.) Fictional bonded polycarbide material from the Daleks' homeworld of Skaro. Is, among other things, a powerful but unstable explosive that will even affect the Daleks' body casings (and, ironically, is also the material used in the makeup of said body casings)."
Dark Metal,DC Comics,"A metal discovered by Batman in the Dark Nights: Metal storyline. It has the power to link the known multiverse with the ""Dark Multiverse."""
Dilithium,Star Trek,"Dilithium (Li2) exists (two covalently bonded lithium); but something else is referred to in fiction. In Star Trek, dilithium occurs in crystal form which serves as a controlling agent in the matter-antimatter reaction cores used to power the faster-than-light warp drive. In the original series, dilithium crystals are rare and cannot be replicated, making the search for them a recurring plot element. When the crystals appear in the original series they look much like petalite, an important ore of lithium. The name dilithium has led to speculation on whether it is meant as an isotope of lithium or a compound with two lithium atoms. But in a periodic table in a Next Generation episode, it is shown as an element with chemical symbol Dt and atomic number 87, which is in reality francium. Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual gives a chemical formula made of real and fictional elements, instead of treating dilithium as its own element."
Divinium (E115),Call of Duty,"Extraterrestrial element found in meteorites. The German research team Group 935 discovers it in northern France in 1918 where zombified Christian knights infect the research team. Seen throughout the 'Zombies' storyline, it powers energy weapons, zombifies (and in some cases mutates) humans, increases the abilities of humans, can bend time and space, and alters firearms. E115 is used in some way by the German Empire, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union; creating zombies every time. The real element 115, moscovium, is unstable, lasting only seconds before decaying radioactively."
Duodecimates,The Face,"Hypothetical stable elements beyond atomic number 120. Such elements are predicted in the real world as an ""Island of stability"". In the novel by Jack Vance, duodecimates were deposited on a planet, Dar Sai, by the explosion of a nearby star. The planet's economy comes to depend on mining and sale of duodecimate ores. It is not revealed what the substance is actually used for."
Duranium,Star Trek,The fictional metal duranium is referred to in many episodes of Star Trek as extremely hard alloys used in starship hulls and hand-held tools.
Durium,Lensman,The fictional synthetic metal durium has a higher moment of inertia than regular materials. It takes more work to move or stop moving than other objects of the same mass.
Dust,RWBY,"Naturally occurring, crystalline energy source found in the world of Remnant. The Aura of Humans and Faunus can activate it. Dust comes in a variety of types, each with different properties such as fire, ice, wind, gravity etc. There are four main kinds; these can be blended naturally or artificially to create new kinds. Crystalline Dust is stable enough to stay out in the open, but powdered Dust is highly volatile, and must be stored in special containers for safety. Dust has a variety of uses, including as a power source for machinery such as airships and robots. Dust may also be used for combat in the form of Dust-filled bullets, as powder placed inside weapons and clothing, or in crystal form for raw power. Dust stops functioning if taken outside of the atmosphere of Remnant, so it can't be used for space travel. In the series, most of Remnant's supply of Dust comes from the Schnee Dust Company, which mines, purifies, and exports the material throughout the world."
Element Zero (0-Ez),Mass Effect,"Element Zero, or ""Eezo"", is naturally created in dying stars and harvested from supernovas. Is used to generate the mass effect fields of many advanced technologies in the Mass Effect universe. Applying a positive or negative charge to this substance reduces or increases the mass of any objects within the emission field. Also found in organics, and the source of biotic abilities. Nodules forming throughout the bodies of most species, such as the Asari. Introduced into human species via alleged experiments by a shadowy government agency."
Element 99,Singularity,"Radioactive orange element with a lead-grey natural form. Purified ore glows orange. Discovered by Soviet scientists looking for uranium for Stalin's nuclear program. An island off the Kamchatka Peninsula codenamed Katorga-12 is sectioned off as a top secret research, mining, and refining facility. After an incident with the E99 generator, the E99 radiation is spread all over the island. E99 can warp time, mutate living organisms grotesquely, and provide a clean, if dangerous, energy source. The real element 99, einsteinium, has no such qualities."
Element 115,"Ufology, various works","Widely known within the sci-fi and UFO community; since, according to ufologist Bob Lazar, it is used by alien engines to generate anti-gravity and propulsion. The real element 115 is moscovium, a synthetic element with an extremely short half-life."
Elerium-115,X-COM: UFO Defense,"Elerium is the main power source and propellant of alien technology in this video game, where the player runs X-COM, an international, top secret, paramilitary organization fighting an alien invasion."
Energon,Transformers,"A substance or form of energy serving as the primary fuel source for the Cybertronian/transformer race. Often takes the form of a liquid, most often as ""energon cubes"" refined from other sources of chemical energy."
Eridium,Borderlands,A priceless alien mineral in the Borderlands francise. TBA
Etherium,Magic: The Gathering,"A magical Aether-infused alloy found on Esper, one of the five shards of the plane of Alara. Most of Esper's inhabitants have parts of their body replaced by etherium. It is also used to craft artifacts like the Filigree texts, sacred texts worked in etherium containing the Vedalken's accumulated knowledge."
Feminum,Wonder Woman,"Found only on Paradise Island. Is the indestructible metal out of which Wonder Woman's bracelets are made. Wonder Woman, and other inhabitants of Paradise Island, use the bracelets to deflect bullets. The material features in the Wonder Woman television series in its fifth episode, ""The Feminum Mystique Part 2"", which aired on 8 November 1976.[citation needed]"
Frinkonium,The Simpsons,"Element, invented by Springfield scientist Professor Frink."
Galine,I Expect You To Die,"Blue liquid with atomic number 3 and symbol Gi that makes a compound that is corrosive to copper when mixed with Arsonium and Sanite, and a compound that explodes when exposed to air when mixed with Nanite. The real element 3 is lithium."
Gaulau,Glinda of Oz,"In L. Frank Baum's last Oz book, published in 1920, Glinda says that the magical ""rare mineral powder called gaulau"" is ""more wonderful even than radium"". The text describes it as ""a grayish powder, the tiny grains of which constantly moved as if impelled by some living force"".  When a magician burns a small amount of gaulau, its magical activity, directed by the correct spoken words or incantations, is capable of powering magical heavy machinery, including an expanding steel column which lifts an entire underwater village (sealed under a glass dome) from the bottom of a large lake to the surface, and holds it at the surface indefinitely, until more gaulau is used to submerge the village again."
Genevium,Giants series,"Rarest of three stable transuranic elements predicted by the new science of nucleonics in James P. Hogan's Giants series. Not naturally occurring outside of neutron stars; trace amounts of genevium are detectable after detonation of nucleonic weapons, but it requires higher yields to produce than hyperium and bonnevillium."
Harbenite,Tarzan at the Earth's Core,"Appears in Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel Tarzan at the Earth's Core.  Harbenite, named after its discoverer, Dr. von Harben, is a metal found in the fictional African country Urambi and is described as lighter than cork and stronger than steel. Harbenite was used to build the O-220, a dirigible airship built for a rescue mission to the Earth's core in response to a radio distress call from David Innes and Abner Perry, the original discoverers of the inner world of Pellucidar in the novel At the Earth's Core."
Hedonium,"Philosophy, futurism","Matter that is optimal for generating pleasure. Nick Bostrom investigates the desirability (or otherwise) of maximizing hedonism in this way. He invokes another fictional substance, computronium, to ""tile the universe"" with the maximal amount of hedonium."
Hyperium,Giants series,"One of three stable transuranic elements predicted by the new science of nucleonics in James P. Hogan's Giants series. Not naturally occurring outside of neutron stars, but trace amounts are created at the detonation of nucleonic weapons."
Ice-nine,Cat's Cradle,"A more stable polymorph of water than common ice (Ice Ih), which instead of melting when above 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit), only melts at 45.8 °C (114.4 °F). When ice-nine comes in contact with liquid water below 45.8 °C, it acts as a seed crystal, and causes the solidification of the entire body of water, which quickly crystallizes as more ice-nine."
Imperial Gold,Rick Riordan,"(Introduced in The Lost Hero.) Enchanted gold. Extremely harmful to magical creatures, but can't harm non-magic ones."
Inerton,Armageddon 2419 A.D.,"Synthetic material, made in a process which allows energy to be converted directly into matter (similar to the replicator later seen in Star Trek). Inerton is totally inert to almost all forces, including light, heat, and gravity; so it is cold to the touch and always pitch black, and completely weightless and indestructible to anything except disintegrator beams (which convert matter directly to energy in the reverse of the process that created the material).
Inerton is used mostly in hulls of futuristic airships, serving as both armor and as a lifting body, as well as in special belts worn by the characters which allow them to leap great distances by counterbalancing the weight of their bodies."
Inertron,Legion of Super-Heroes,"The hardest substance in the DC Universe. Often used in the Legion of Super-Heroes comics, especially by Element Lad, who uses his transmutation ability to craft prisons and shields from it."
Inoson,E. E. Smith's SkyLark series,"A synthetic metal; has ""the theoretical ultimate in strength possible for any material possessing molecular structure."" Much superior to the Dagal of the Urvanians or the Arenak of the Osnomians."
Jerktonium,It's a SpongeBob Christmas!,"A green superheavy element]. Ingestion of jerktonium causes a bad attitude, but the effects are curable by song. Other side effects of ingesting this element include a fast growth of stubble, a look of fatigue radiated by bags under the eyelids, and thick eyebrows."
Jumbonium,Futurama,"Very rare and valuable element with atoms big enough to be seen by naked eye. In the episode ""The Lesser of Two Evils"", a Jumbonium atom is used in 3001 used for the Miss Universe competition, where it hovers above the prized tiara. According to Bob Barker (in the episode), the atom is worth $200,000 or, at least, somewhere between $200,000 and $200,001. Professor Farnsworth says the nucleus alone is worth $150,000."
Katchin,Dragon Ball Z,"Said to be the hardest material in the Dragon Ball universe. When testing the Z Sword, Goku throws a cube of Katchin, which was summoned by Supreme Kai, at Son Gohan in order to test the sword's supposed legendary strength. The block of Katchin proceeds to snap the Z Sword when Gohan tries to slice it."
Kryptonite,DC Comics,"A crystalline material, originally in various colors with separate effects, harmful to Kryptonians and created during the destruction of Superman's home planet Krypton; synthesis is also possible. John Byrne's retcon of the DC Comics universe established green kryptonite as a compound and later issues had experiments by Batman and Luthor reestablish the Pre-Crisis versions of red, blue, and gold. Kryptonite has been found in the real world (according to its chemical composition) and has none of the properties or color variations of fictional kryptonite. However, DC Comics had previously described kryptonite as an alien element with a higher atomic number than known Earth elements."
Kyber crystal,Star Wars,"A rare, semi-sentient, crystalline material found across the galaxy. Kyber crystals vary in shape and color, but all are deeply connected to the Force, the vast energy field connecting all living things. They are most commonly used by the Jedi and Sith in making lightsabers; but larger, rarer crystals are sometimes used in superweapons, including the planet destroying Death Star."
Lerasium,Mistborn,"A metal forming the body and power of the shard Preservation that makes any non-allomancer who ingests it an extremely powerful mistborn. All known samples are destroyed after the last was ingested by Elend Venture. It is the source of the Lord Ruler's and the first noble's Allomantic abilities, being found by Rashek at the well of ascension. Its Allomantic, Feruchemic and Hemalurgic powers are unknown. It is named after the holder of Preservation, Leras."
Metal X (Rovolon),E. E. Smith's SkyLark series,"An element discovered that facilitates conversion of the energy in metals (copper or uranium) and uses it as a propulsive or attractive force. The Norlaminians had already discovered this metal and named it Rovolon. However, they had only trace amounts found in meteorites."
Meteorillium,Return to Castle Wolfenstein,Element found in meteors theorized to originate in the center of the galaxy. The Schutzstaffel's Special Projects Division discovers some of the rare element in the Baltic states. Oberführer Strasse's project book indicates that the SS Paranormal Division needs it for the resurrection of King Henry the Fowler. Strasse's lab in Norway refines the metal into its 317 isotope for use in the ceremony.
Mithril / Mythril,Various,"Originally from in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. A durable silvery metal; very light and extremely strong. Mithril means ""grey gleam"", but is translated as ""true silver"". It is mined in native form in Moria. It can also be worked into other forms with unusual properties such as reflecting only the light of the Moon. The fictional metal has appeared in other fantasy universes, games, and books. ""Mythril"" appears in the video game series Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts. ""Mithral"" is used in D&D books; ""Milrith"" in Simon the Sorcerer. In Warhammer, the High Elven metal ""Ithilmar"" has similar properties and use. In RuneScape it is a lightweight blue metal stronger than steel. In World of Warcraft, Mithril and Truesilver both appear; Truesilver is a rare spawn node in the same areas as Mithril. Both can be mined as ore and smelted into a bar using the mining profession. Mithril also appears in the MMORPG Guild Wars 2 as a blueish-silver metal used in crafting. In Defense of the Ancients, the multiplayer online battle arena version of Warcraft, players can buy the Mithril Hammer from the Main Shop. ""Mithral"" also features in the Dungeon Master series. It appears in armor form in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It appears as a cyan metal used to make armor and weapons in MapleStory. Mythril is also depicted as a teal-color metal used to craft armor, weapons, and tools in Terraria."
Nanite,I Expect You To Die,"A yellow liquid with the atomic number 13 and the symbol Nn that makes a compound that explodes when exposed to air when mixed with Galine, and an antivirus when mixed with Regalite and Sanite. The real element 13 is aluminium."
Naqahdah,Stargate,"A rare, superheavy metal first depicted (but not named) as a quartzite-like ""mineral"" in the original Stargate movie. Its most basic use is as a weapon: naquadah greatly amplifies energy, making it extremely potent if paired with explosives. Due to its unique properties, naquadah forms the basis for many advanced technologies; the Stargates themselves are almost entirely made of naqadah. Naqadah also occurs in the bloodstream of the Goa'uld, which allows them to control their technology and sense the presence of other symbiotes. The Goa'uld have naquadah mining operations on many planets; its refined form, ""weapons-grade naquadah"", is extremely valuable and often used as currency. Weapons-grade naquadah is so dense that two Jaffa are required to lift a quantity the size of a couple of common bricks, which probably indicates that naquadah is in the island of stability. Other forms of naquadah include liquid naquadah, used to power Goa'uld staff weapons, and heavy liquid naquadah, used to power Goa'uld AG-3 weapon satellites. Naquadah is a superconductor. Naquadah does not occur naturally in the Solar System.
Naquadriah, discovered and mined on Kelowna, is an unstable isotope that is 100 times more powerful, and is mostly used for weapons of mass destruction."

Nth Metal,DC Comics,"Fictional alloy; described as a heavy isotope, 676Fe. Native to Thanagar, home planet of Katar Hol and Shayera Thal, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman. Its unusual properties include ability to negate gravity, allowing a person wearing an object made of it, such as a belt, to fly. Nth metal also protects the wearer from the elements and speeds healing of wounds, increases their strength, and protects them from temperature extremes. It has many other properties that are yet to be revealed in full. It has been implied that the apparently ""magical"" abilities of the Thanagarian supervillain, Onimar Synn, all stem from his unique mastery of the properties of Nth metal. These powers are augmented to a god-like level during the Rann-Thanagar War when he builds himself an artificial body made of the substance.
In ancient Egypt a Thanagarian spaceship made of Nth metal crash-landed, only to be found by Prince Khufu and his betrothed, Chay-ara. Constant exposure to Nth metal forced Khufu and Chay-ara into a cycle of reincarnation. In the 20th century, they are incarnated as Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders, the original Hawkman and Hawkgirl. As Hawkman and Hawkgirl, they wear Nth metal belts, made with the help of the Thanagarian Paran Katar, father of Katar Hol, when he is visiting Earth.
Many years later, Carter and Shiera's son, Hector Hall, made a suit of armor of Nth metal and took the name Silver Scarab as a founding member of Infinity Inc. The suit gave him protection from attacks, let him lift great weights, and allowed him to fly and project solar energy blasts.
The current Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to wear Nth metal.
Much later in the DC timeline, members of the Legion of Super Heroes wear ""flight rings"" made of an alloy of Nth metal called valorium.
The mercenary Deathstroke wears armor made of Nth metal."
